* Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth. The minimum depth is the
* number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the
* nearest leaf node.
*
* Note: A leaf is a node with no children.
*
* Example:
* Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],
*       3
*      / \
*     9 20
*       / \
*      15 7
* return its minimum depth = 2.
